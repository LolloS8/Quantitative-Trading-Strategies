# Trading & Machine Learning 

This repository is dedicated to the exploration, implementation, and rigorous backtesting of quantitative trading strategies using Python and Machine Learning.

Leveraging core data science and finance libraries such as pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, and yfinance, the projects within this portfolio cover a range of key quant concepts:

Market Regime Detection: Using Unsupervised Learning (K-Means) to identify different market states.

Volatility Forecasting: Modeling and predicting market risk with GARCH models.

Directional Prediction: Applying Supervised Learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forests) to forecast market direction.

Strategy Backtesting: Building and evaluating the performance of algorithmic strategies against benchmarks.

Statistical Arbitrage: Exploring the foundations of market-neutral strategies through cointegration analysis.

This repository documents my practical journey into applying data-driven methods to financial markets, with the goal of developing the skills required for a career in quantitative finance.
